20040326:
Added to the "View Commander" screen the bounty offered for the capture of the player, if he's at least a crook, and the numbers of kingpins wanting to kill him, if he's at least trusted ; this helps keeping track with the PoliceRecordScore
Added the shipyard special event (5 different events, in fact) that are randomly placed on 5 High-Tech planets among the galaxy. You'll be proposed to design your own ship, for 150,000 cr. ; the special event stays here even if it has been used
Modified the color of the "Special" button to yellow, so it is more remarkable
Added a tooltip to the "Special" button to show the title of the special event
Added a tooltip to the "Mercenary for hire" button to show the name of the mercenary


TODO:
in Form_Alert.cs : move the strings to a resource
in Form_Encounter.cs: move as much code as possible out of the GUI class
