20040326:
Added to the "View Commander" screen the bounty offered for the capture of the player, if he's at least a crook, and the numbers of kingpins wanting to kill him, if he's at least trusted ; this helps keeping track with the PoliceRecordScore
Added the shipyards, that are randomly placed on 5 High-Tech planets among the galaxy. You'll be proposed to design your own ship
Modified the ship and shipspec structures to allow for custom ship designs
Modified the buy/sell equipment screen
Modified the color of the "Special" button to yellow, so it is more remarkable
Added a tooltip to the "Special" button to show the title of the special event
Added a tooltip to the "Mercenary for hire" button to show the name of the mercenary
